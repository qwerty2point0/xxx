        <center>I am Joylyn Zuniga
            19 years old, turning 20 
            <br>this coming June.<br>
            I lived in Shalom, Luna,Apayao.<br><br>
            One thing about me that is important to know <br>
            though is that, at first<br> 
            I come of as a very shy individualistic girl, but once<br>
            I get to know people and are comfortable<br>
            with my environment, I am great.<br> 
            It is hard for me to make friends but once I make some,<br> 
            itâ€™s great and I am all different. I am  sensitive girl <br>
            as my close friends will tell you.<br> 
            I have a tough shell but on the inside  I am soft.<br><br>
            I hate <i>"pasipsip"</i> ,<i>"pabida"</i>  students<br>
            and teachers who have favoritisms lol.</br> 
            I hate those people who see me as their competition. <br><br>
            The things I loved to do is reading books<br>
            while listening to music and<br>
            coffee.
